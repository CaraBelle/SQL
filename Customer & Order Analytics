#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.  Some questions show more than one way to get the answer.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LIMIT 20;

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.customers
LIMIT 20;

SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID';

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT MIN(price)
, Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT distinct product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product
, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Revenue ASC;

SELECT orderid, quantity, price, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

SELECT SUM(quantity), price, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT location
, Quantity
, Product
, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY location, Quantity, Product;

SELECT
sum(Quantity),
product,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum)
, AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the prodcuts sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product
, SUM(Quantity) TotalSold
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY TotalSold ASC;
